# PM-Notebooks
--------------
> Jupyter Notebook Demos for Power Management (PM) Features
> [Xilinx wiki](https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18842232)

NOTE
----
The demos have a dependency on 'python3-ipywidgets' package which is an extension to Jupyter Notebook core.
This comes pre-installed in the rootfs from official Petalinux BSPs.
However, you need to enable it once before running the demos. Run following from linux command line:

	$ jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension

To spawn a Jupyter notebook server pointing to default notebook directory for pm-notebooks, run:

	$ jupyter notebook --allow-root --no-browser --notebook-dir=/usr/share/pm-notebooks --ip=<your-ip>

Now use the link provided by the server to connect to it from any browser client from the same network.

The demos included are:
- CPU Hotplug Demo
- CPU Frequency Scaling Demo
